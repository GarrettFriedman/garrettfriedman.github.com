<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Garrett Friedman. I am a third year student
at Tufts University currently studying Biochemistry, graduating with a
bachelor's degree from the school of arts and sciences in May 2014.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10th 1992, and
have since then lived in the Boston area.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon graduation I plan to enroll in medical school.</p>
